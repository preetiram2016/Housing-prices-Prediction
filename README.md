# Housing-prices-Prediction
In this project I have predicted housing prices based on several factors using Linear Regression and VIF for feature selection.
It is useful for both clients(public and real-estate builders) to assess the housing prices to purchase or to sell.
I have used 70% of cleaned data for building model and 30% of cleaned data for validation and finally used model on test data and evaluated model with RMSE.
